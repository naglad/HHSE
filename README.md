# Home and Hospital Student Enrollment 
## Project Name: Home & Hospital Student Enrollment 

# Project Description: 
> Home/hospital instruction is typically one-to-one or small-group instruction that is provided on an individualized schedule, for less than a full school day or a full school week
The description and definition of the project can be found here
This Application will help Boston Public Schools and other districts assign students to education while they are out of school due to medical reasons.

> What is the issue? 
The assignment of students and matches to tutors takes an extensive amount of time since the process is manual and involves many external parties in addition to internal parties until the students get the service  
Feating/hiring retired teachers also takes time and matches their wages 

> How to Solve the issue 
By integrating 90% of the process into automated AI, we can reduce the waiting time for students to get the service and have more students receive the service where they need the most
