I need a streamlit application that read from a defined email address with Subject that includes HHSE. 
Application will extract the excel file attached to the email, parse it's data into a sqlite database. 
This sqlite database needs to have a friendly GUI for user to query on.
Ask me calirfing questions before running this through to clear any doubts

Result #1 from Phind:
To clarify and ensure I provide you with the most accurate solution, I have a few questions:

1. **Email Provider**: Which email service provider are you using (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)? This is crucial for setting up the email reading part of the application.
	Answer> It is a Gmail, specific email address is ramy.hegazy73@gmail.compatibility
	
2. **SQLite Database Schema**: Could you provide the schema of the SQLite database you want to use? This includes the table names, column names, and data types.
	Answer> what is meant by schema of the SQLite database?
	
	
3. **Streamlit Version**: Which version of Streamlit are you using? This is important to ensure compatibility with the code examples provided.
	Answer> not sure, how do i find out?


4. **Python Version**: What version of Python are you using? This is to ensure that the code is compatible with your environment.
	Answer> Version 3.11
	
5. **Excel File Format**: What is the format of the Excel files you're expecting to receive? This will help in parsing the files correctly.
	Answer> What is meant by what format, please explain in detail.


6. **GUI Requirements**: What specific queries or operations do you want the GUI to support? This will help in designing the GUI to meet your needs.
	Answer> Drop this part of the project for now. Later on, an enhancement to the application will include this feature.


7. **Security Considerations**: How do you plan to handle sensitive information, such as email credentials and database passwords? This is crucial for security best practices.
	Answer> Please suggest best solution. Application will be shared with other users after deployment.


8. **Deployment**: Where do you plan to deploy this application? This will influence the choice of tools and libraries for certain parts of the application.
	Answer>  Application will be deployed on streamlit.io site



Please provide answers to these questions so I can tailor the solution to your specific needs.

Response of Phind to the above:
-------------------------------

Thank you for providing the details. Let's address each point:

1. **Email Provider**: Since you're using Gmail, we'll use the GMAIL API to read emails from your specified address.

2. **SQLite Database Schema**: The schema of an SQLite database refers to the structure of the database, including the names of tables, the columns within those tables, and the data types of each column. For example, a simple schema for a database that stores information about employees might include a table named `employees` with columns for `id`, `name`, `email`, and `department`.

3. **Streamlit Version**: To find out your Streamlit version, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   streamlit --version
   ```
   This will output the version of Streamlit installed in your environment.

4. **Python Version**: You've mentioned using Python 3.11. This is a recent version and should be compatible with most modern libraries and frameworks.

5. **Excel File Format**: The format of the Excel files you're expecting to receive refers to the file extension, such as `.xlsx` for Excel files. This is important because different formats might require different parsing libraries or methods.

6. **GUI Requirements**: Since you've decided to drop this part of the project for now, we'll focus on the email reading and database part.

7. **Security Considerations**: For handling sensitive information like email credentials and database passwords, it's best to use environment variables or a secure configuration file that is not included in the version control system. You can use Python's `os` module to access environment variables.

8. **Deployment**: Deploying on streamlit.io is straightforward and well-documented. You'll need to create an account on streamlit.io, install the Streamlit CLI, and then use the `streamlit run` command to deploy your application.

Before proceeding, could you clarify the following:
- **SQLite Database Schema**: Specifically, what data will the Excel files contain, and how do you envision structuring this data in the SQLite database?
- **Excel File Format**: What is the file extension of the Excel files you're expecting to receive?

These clarifications will help in designing the application more accurately.
